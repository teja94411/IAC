# Terraform

Terraform is an open-source tool by HashiCorp that lets you define, create, and manage Infrastructure as Code. Using a simple configuration language (HCL or JSON), you can manage resources across multiple platforms like AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, and GitHub. It handles everything from low-level components like servers and networks to high-level resources like DNS and SaaS features, ensuring your infrastructure is consistent, versioned, and automated.
